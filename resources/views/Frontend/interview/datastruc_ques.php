						<h3>Data Structures Interview Questions and Answers</h3>
                      
						<p class="qus">1. Explain what is data structure?</p>
						<p class="ans">The data structure is nothing but an entity where the data is perfectly aligned and can be manipulated as per the requirement. When we deal with data structure it is not just about one table of data but it is about different data sets and how well they are aligned with each other. Overall, it helps the data to be organized.</p>
                      
                      <p class="qus">2. What are the basic operations performed on various data structures?</p>
                      <p class="ans">The basic operations performed on data structures are as follows:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>* Insertion - Adds a new data element in the data structure.</li>
                        <li>* Deletion - Removes a data element in a data structure.</li>
                        <li>* Searching - Involves searching for a specified data element in a data structure.</li>
                        <li>* Traversal - Processing all data elements present in it.</li>
                        <li>* Merging - Combines two similar data structures to form a new data structure of the same type.</li>
                        <li>* Sorting - Arranging data elements of a data structure in a specified order.</li>
                      </ol>
                      
                      <p class="qus">3. Explain what is a linked list?</p>
						<p class="ans">A linked list is nothing but a sequence of nodes. With this sequence, each node is connected to the following node. It forms a chain of data storage.</p>
						<p class="qus">4. Explain the process of how do you reference all the elements in the one-dimension array in detail?</p>
						<p class="ans">To reference all the elements in the one-dimension array, we have to use an indexed loop. With the help of this, it executes from “0” to array size minus one. By following this process the loop counter will be able to refer to all the elements.</p>
						<p class="qus">5. List out the areas where the data structure is applied?</p>
						<p class="ans">The data structure is a vital aspect while handling data. The following are specific areas where the data structure is applied:<br>
<ol>						
<li>●	Numerical analysis</li>
<li>●	Operating systems</li>
<li>●	A.I.</li>
<li>●	Database management</li>
<li>●	Statistical analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>The above are few areas where the data structure is applied and not limited to.
                       </p>
                       <p class="qus">6. What is infix, prefix, and postfix in data structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The way to write arithmetic expressions is known as notation. There are three types of notations used in an arithmetic expression, i.e., without changing the essence or output of expression. These notations are:<br>
<ol>					   
<li>●	Prefix (Polish) Notation - In this, the operator is prefixed to operands, i.e. ahead of operands.</li>
<li>●	Infix Notation - In this, operators are used in between operands.</li>
<li>●	Postfix (Reverse-Polish) Notation - In this, the operator is postfixed to the operands, i.e., after the operands.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following table briefly tries to show the difference in all three notations −
                        </p><br>

						<p class="qus">7. Explain the terminology LIFO?</p>
						<p class="ans">LIFO stands for Last In First Out.<br>
This process describes how the data is accessed, stored, and then retrieved. So the latest data that is stored in the database can be extracted first.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">8. Explain what is a binary tree?</p>
					   <p class="ans"> It is one type of data structure that has two nodes, has left node and a right node. In a programming language, binary trees are considered to be an extension to the linked list.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">9. Define what is a stack?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The stack is considered as a data structure where the top layer element can be accessed. The data is stored in the stack and every time when data is stored, it pushes the data downwards which enables the users to access the latest data from the top layers.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">10. Explain what is multidimensional arrays?</p>
                       <p class="ans">Multidimensional arrays use multiple indexes in order to store data in the database. In a few scenarios, data cannot be stored using a single dimension index, in these scenarios multidimensional arrays are useful.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">11. Explain whether a linked list is considered as a linear or non-linear data structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">This is purely determined on the requirement basis, a linked list can be considered as a linear data structure or a non-linear data structure. For example: If the linked list is used on storage, then the linked list is considered as a nonlinear data structure.<br>
If linked lists are used against access strategies then they are considered as a linear data structure.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">12. Explain how does dynamic memory allocation will help you in managing data?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A dynamic memory allocation will help you effectively manage your data by allocating structured blocks to have composite structures that can be flexible, i.e. it can expand and can contract based on the need.<br>
Also, they are capable of storing simple structured data types.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">13. What is FIFO?</p>
					   <p class="ans">FIFO in data terminology stands as “First in, First Out”.<br>
This process defines or depicts how the data is stored inserted and accessed in a queue. Within this process, the data that is inserted at the beginning of the queue will only be extracted or accessed first.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">14. Explain what is merge sort and how it is useful?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A merge sort is nothing but a process where the data is divided and sorted to reach the end goal. Within this process, the adjacent elements are merged and sorted to create bigger elements. These sorted elements are gathered again and made the even bigger list. This process is continuous and repetitive until and unless they have nailed it down to a single sorted list.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">15. List out all the advantages of a linked list?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The important aspect or advantage of a linked list is that it is the perfect data structure where the data can be modified very easily. Also, it doesn’t matter how many elements are available on the linked list.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">16. Explain the main difference between PUSH and a POP?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The two main activities, i.e. Pushing and Popping applies the way how data is stored and retrieved in an entity. So if you check in detail, a Push is nothing but a process where data is added to the stack.  On the contrary, a Pop is an activity where data is retrieved from the stack. When we discuss data retrieval it only considers the topmost available data.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">17. Can you explain with an example how does a variable declaration activity will consume or affect the memory allocation?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The amount of space or memory is occupied or allocated depends upon the data type of the variables that are declared. So let’s explain the same by considering an example:  Let’s say the variable is declared as an integer type then 32 bits of memory storage is allocated for that particular variable.<br>
So based on the data type of the variable, the memory space will be allocated.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">18. Define the advantages and disadvantages of the heap compared to a stack?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The advantages of the heap compared to a stack are listed below:
<ol>					   
<li>1.	Heap is more flexible when compared to a stack</li>
<li>2.	Memory space of the heap can actually be allocated and de-allocated as per the need.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the contrary, the disadvantages of the heap compared to a stack is listed below:
<ol>
<li>1.	The memory of the heap is slower when compared to the memory of the stack</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">19. Explain how new data can be inserted into the tree?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The following are the steps that you need to follow to insert the data into the tree:<br>
<ol>
<li>1.	First of all, check whether the data is unique or not ( i.e. check whether the data that you are going to insert doesn’t already exist in the tree).</li>
<li>2.	Then check if the tree is empty. If the tree is empty then all you need to do is just insert a new item into the root.  If the key is smaller than that of a root’s key then insert that data into the root’s left subtree or otherwise, insert the data into the right side of the root’s subtree.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">20. Can you tell me the minimum number of nodes that a binary tree can have?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A binary tree is allowed or can have a minimum of zero nodes. Further, a binary tree can also have 1 or 2 nodes.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">21. Explain a little bit about the dynamic data structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The nature of the dynamic data structure is different compared to the standard data structures, the word dynamic data structures means that the data structure is flexible in nature. As per the need, the data structure can be expanded and contracted. Thus it helps the users to manipulate the data without worrying too much about the data structure flexibility.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">22. Define what is an array?</p>
					   <p class="ans">While referring to array the data is stored and utilized based on the index and this number actually co-relates to the element number in the data sequence. So thus making it flexible to access data in any order. Within programming language, an array is considered as a variable having a certain number of indexed elements.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">23. Can you tell me the minimum number of queues that are needed to implement a priority queue?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The minimum number of queues that are needed is two. Out of which, one queue is intended for sorting priorities and the other queue is meant for the actual storage of data.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">24. List out all different sorting algorithms that are available and state which sorting algorithm is considered as the fastest?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The list of all sorting algorithms are below:<br>
<ol>					   
<li>1.	Quicksort</li>
<li>2.	Bubble sort</li>
<li>3.	Balloon sort</li>
<li>4.	Radix sort</li>
<li>5.	Merge sort</li>
<p>Out of the above sorting options, none of the sorting algorithms can be tagged as the fastest algorithm, because each of these sorting algorithms is defined for a specific purpose. So based on the data structure and data sets available the sorting algorithms are used.</p>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">25. Explain what is a dequeue?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A de queue is nothing but a double-ended queue. Within this structure, the elements can be inserted or deleted from both sides.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">26. Explain the process of how a selection sort works?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A selection sort is a process where it picks up the smallest number from the entire data setlist and places it at the beginning. The same process is continued where the second position is already filled in. The same process is continued all the way until the list is completed. The selection sort is defined as a simple sort algorithm when compared to others.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">27. Explain what is a graph?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A graph is nothing but a type of data structure that has a set of ordered pairs. In turn, these pairs are again acknowledged as edges or arcs. These are used to connect different nodes where the data can be accessed and stored based on the needs.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">28. Is it possible to implement a stack using a queue?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Yes, you can implement a stack using two queues. Any data structure to act like a stack should have a push() method to add data on top and a pop() method to remove the top data.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">29. How would you implement a queue using a stack?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Using two stacks, you can implement a queue. The purpose is to complete the queue's en queue operation so that the initially entered element always ends up at the top of the stack.<br>
<ol>				   
<li>●	First, to enqueue an item into the queue, migrate all the elements from the beginning stack to the second stack, push the item into the stack, and send all elements back to the first stack.</li>
<li>●	To dequeue an item from the queue, return the top item from the first stack.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">30. Where is the LRU cache used in data structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">In data structures, you use LRU (Least Recently Used) cache to organize items in order of use, enabling you to quickly find out which item hasn't been used for a long time.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">31. Which Data Structure is used to implement LRU cache? </p>
					   <p class="ans">To implement the LRU cache, you should use two data structures: a hashmap and a doubly linked list.<br>
A hashmap helps with the lookup of cached keys, and a doubly-linked list helps maintain the eviction order.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">32. What is the difference between an array and a linked list?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Array and Linked list are two ways of organizing the data in memory. The below table lists the various differences between the array and linked lists:
                       </p><br>
					   <table class="table table-striped">
						  <thead>
							<tr>
							  <th scope="col">Array</th>
							  <th scope="col">Linked List</th>
							</tr>
						  </thead>
						  <tbody>
							<tr>
							  <td>An array is a sequence of elements of a similar data type.</td>
							  <td>A Linked list is a set of objects known as a node, where it internally consists of two parts, i.e., data and address.</td>

							  <td>In arrays, memory allocation is done during compile time.</td>
							  <td>In linked lists, memory allocation is done during runtime.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
							  <td>Array size must be defined at the time of declaration/initialization.</td>
							  <td>Linked list size grows when new elements are inserted or deleted.</td>
							</tr>

						<p class="qus">33. What are the advantages of Linked Lists over Array?</p>
						<p class="ans">The following are the advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Dynamic Data Structure - A Linked list is a dynamic data structure so that it can grow at runtime by deallocating and allocating memory. There is no need to present the linked list initial size.</li>
<li>●	Insertion and Deletion Operations - Insertion and Deletion operations are easier in linked lists. You need to have to update the address present in the next pointer of a node.</li>
<li>●	Implementation - Data structures like queue, tree, and stack are easily implemented using the Linked list.</li>
<li>●	No memory wastage - Efficient memory utilization can be achieved in the linked lists.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">34. What are the applications of a stack in a data structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Following are some of the essential applications in a data structure:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Expression evaluation</li>
<li>●	Backtracking </li>
<li>●	Function calling and return</li>
<li>●	Memory management</li>
<li>●	Checking parenthesis matching in an expression</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">35. What are the different types of Linked List?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The following are the different types of Linked Lists.<br>
●	Singly Linked List - This is the most common type, and each node has data and a pointer to the next node.<br>
<img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/list1.png" style="width:500px;" /><br>
●	Doubly Linked List - In this type, the pointer is added to the previous node, either in a forward or backward direction.<br>
<img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/list2.png" style="width:500px;" /><br>
●	Circular Linked List - In this type, the last element is linked to the first element.<br>
 <img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/list3.png" style="width:500px;" /><br>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">36. What is the difference between storage structure and file structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The main difference between storage structure and file structure depends on the memory area that is accessed.<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Storage structure: It's a data structure representation in computer memory.</li> 
<li>●	File structure: It's a storage structure representation in the auxiliary memory.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">37. What operations can be performed on a stack?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Mainly the following operations are performed on a stack:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Push operation: To add an item to the stack. If the stack is complete, then it is in an overflow condition.</li> 
<li>●	Pop operation: It is used to remove an item from the stack. If it's an empty stack, then it is in underflow condition.</li>
<li>●	isEmpty operation: If the stack is empty returns true, else false.</li> 
<li>●	Peek or Top operation: This returns the top element of the stack.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">38. Name some applications of data structures?</p>
					   <p class="ans">
<ol>
<li>●	Operating system</li> 
<li>●	Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>●	Statistical analysis</li> 
<li>●	Database management</li>
<li>●	Compiler design</li> 
<li>●	Graphics</li>
<li>●	Simulation </li> 
<li>●	Numerical analysis</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">39. Explain about Linked List Data Structure.</p>
					   <p class="ans">A linked list is a series of data structures connected via links. In simple words, it's a sequence of links that contain items. After the array, the linked list is the second most used data structure. The essential terms to understand the linked list are:<br>
<ol>					   
<li>Link - In a linked list, each link stores data called an element.</li> 
<li>Next - In a linked list, each link is connected to the following link called next.</li> 
<li>LinkedList -  It contains the connection link to the first link called first.</li>
</ol>
<p>The below diagram depicts how nodes are connected in the Linked List:</p><br>
<img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/node.png" style="width:500px;"/><br>
<p>Basic operations supported by a linked list:</p>
<ol>
<li>●	Insertion - Inserts an element at the list beginning.</li> 
<li>●	Deletion - Deletes an element at the list beginning.</li>
<li>●	Display - Displays the complete list.</li> 
<li>●	Search - Searches an element using the given key.</li>
<li>●	Delete - Deletes an element using the given key.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">40. Are linked lists considered non-linear or linear data structures?</p>
					   <p class="ans">It depends on where you plan to use Linked lists. You can consider a linked list for both non-linear and linear data structures. When used for data storage, it is regarded as a non-linear data structure. When used for access strategies, it is considered a linear data structure.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">41. What is a doubly-linked list used for?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A doubly linked list is one of the complex types of the linked list, where a node contains a pointer to the previous and the next node in the sequence. It consists of three parts: node data, a pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer), a pointer to the previous node (previous pointer)<br>
The below diagram depicts the working of doubly linked list:<br>
<img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/doubly-linked.png" style="width:400px;"/><br>
<p>Some of the real-time applications where doubly-linked lists used are navigation systems and browsers (when both back and front navigation is required).
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">42. What is a queue in data structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A queue is a linear data structure that supports a specific order in which operations are performed. The order is FIFO (First in First Out) methodology, i.e., data items stored first will be accessed first. Unlike stack, the queue is open at both ends, and one end is always used to insert data and another one to remove data.<br>
The basic operations associated with queues -<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Dequeue - To remove an item</li>
<li>●	Enqueue - To insert an item</li>
<li>●	isempty() − Confirms whether the queue is empty.</li>
<li>●	isfull() − Confirms whether the queue is full.</li>
<li>●	peek() − Gets the element at the front of the queue without removing it.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">43. List a few queue data structure applications.</p>
					   <p class="ans">As the name suggests, the queue is used whenever you need to manage a group of objects in the order FIFO. A few of the queue data structure applications are listed below:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Serving requests on a single shared resource, like CPU task scheduling, printer, etc.</li>
<li>●	Handling interruptions in real-time systems.</li>
<li>●	Buffers in apps like CD player and MP3 media players</li>
<li>●	In maintaining a playlist in media players, like adding or removing songs.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">44. What is the difference between stack and heap?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Both stack and heap are used for memory needs. The stack is primarily used to save the method execution order and local variables, and always follow the LIFO order.<br>
Whereas heap is used for dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. It stores objects in Java. Memory allocated to the heap lives until one of the following events occurs:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Memory free</li>
<li>●	Program terminated</li>
</ol>
<p>The size of heap memory is more when using recursion when compared with the stack, as it quickly fill-ups stack memory.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">45. Name a few graph data structure applications.</p>
					   <p class="ans">Applications of graph data structures in real-time are:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Social graphs</li>
<li>●	Path optimization algorithms</li>
<li>●	Recommendation engines</li>
<li>●	Scientific computations</li>
</ol>

					   <p class="qus">46. What is an AVL tree?</p>
					   <p class="ans">An AVL (Adelson, Velskii, and Landi) is a self-balancing binary search tree where the variation of heights of the right and left subtrees of any node is not more than one.<br>
An example of an AVL tree:<br>

                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">49. What is the max heap in the data structure?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A max heap in a data structure is a complete binary tree where each internal node's value is greater than or equal to that node's children's values.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">50. How to find the height of a node in a tree?</p>
					   <p class="ans">You can find the height of a binary tree using a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, as shown below:<br>
<ol>					   
<li>●	Base case: If there is no node, return 0.</li>
<li>●	Else: If there are 1 or 2 children, return the peak of the height of the left and right subtrees, plus 1 to account for the current node.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">51. List the types of trees.</p>
					   <p class="ans">
<ol>					   
<li>●	General Tree</li>

<li>●	Forests</li>
<li>●	Expression Tree</li>
<li>●	Binary Search Tree</li>

                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">52. Which data structures do you use in DFS and BFS algorithms?</p>
					   <p class="ans">
<ol>					   
<li>●	In the DFS algorithm, you use the Stack data structure.</li>
<li>●	In the BFS algorithm, you use the Queue data structure.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">53. Explain the postfix expression.</p>
					   <p class="ans">In a postfix expression, the operator is fixed after the operands. Some examples are:<br>
<ol>					   
<li>●	B++ (i.e. B+B)</li>
<li>●	AB+ (i.e. A+B)</li>
<li>●	ABC*+ (i.e. A+B*C)</li>
<li>●	AB*CD*+ (i.e. A*B + C*D)</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">54. What is a binary search? When is it best used?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A binary search is an algorithm that starts with searching from the middle element. If the middle element is not the target element then it checks if it should search the lower half or the higher half. The process continues until the target element is found.<br>
The binary search works best when applied to a list with sorted or ordered elements.<br>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">55. How does dynamic memory allocation help in managing data?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Dynamic memory allocation helps in storing simple structured data types. It can also combine separately allocated structured blocks for forming composite structures that contract and expand as required.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">56. What is the difference between NULL and VOID?</p>
					   <p class="ans">While NULL is a value, VOID is a data type identifier. A variable assigned with a NULL value represents an empty value. The VOID is used for identifying pointers having no initial size.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">57. If you are using the language C to implement the heterogeneous linked list, what pointer type should be used?</p>
					   <p class="ans">We can use void pointers. Unsigned char pointers are another option. This way, we can store any data type in the list. For example:<br>
structa{<br>

structa *next;<br>

s_ize d_size;<br>

 }
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">58. How does variable declaration affect memory allocation?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The total amount of memory to be allocated or reserved in the case of a variable declaration depends on the data type used. For instance, declaring an integer type variable reserves 4 bytes of memory space while declaring a double variable reserves 8 bytes of the available memory.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">59. Write the syntax in C to create a node in the singly linked list.</p>
					   <p class="ans">newNode = Node(data); //creates a new node.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">60. What is data abstraction?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Data abstraction helps in dividing complex data problems into smaller, easy-to-manage parts. It starts with specifying all the involved data objects and the various operations to be performed without worrying too much about the way data is stored.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">61. Write a C program to insert a node in a circular singly list at the beginning.</p>
					   <p class="ans">In a circular linked list, the last pointer points to the head (first node). For this, we use an external pointer that points to the last node, and the last->next points to the first node. We take the last node pointer because it saves us from traversing the entire list while inserting a node in the beginning or end.<br> 
Program steps<br>\
<ol>
<li>●	Create a node N</li>
<li>●	N->next = last->next</li>
<li>●	last->next = N</li>
</ol>
<p>
Code:<br>
struct Node *addBeginning(struct Node *last, int data)<br>

{<br>

/*check if list empty, if so create a node, else proceed as below*/<br>

// dynamically create a node<br>

 struct Node *N <br>

= (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));<br> 

 // Assign the data.<br> 

 N -> data = data; <br>

 // last pointer becomes the first node<br> 

 N -> next = last -> next; <br>

 last -> next = N;<br> 

 return last; <br>

}
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">62. How do you insert a new item in a binary search tree?</p>
					   <p class="ans">As a binary search tree doesn’t allow for duplicates, the new item to be inserted must be unique. Assuming it is, we will proceed with checking whether the tree is empty or not. If it is empty, then the new item will be inserted into the root node.<br>
However, if the tree is non-empty, then we will refer to the key of the new item. When it is smaller than the root item’s key, the new item will be added to the left subtree. If the new item’s key is bigger than the root item’s key, then the new item is inserted into the right subtree.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">63. Write the pseudocode to perform in-order traversal on a binary tree.</p>
					   <p class="ans">In-order traversal is a depth-first traversal. The method is called recursively to perform traversal on a binary tree. The code is as follows:<br>
structbtnode<br>

{<br>

structbtnode *left;<br>

structbtnode *right;<br>

}<br>

*root = NULL, *temp = NULL;<br>

voidinorder(struct btnode *temp)<br>

{<br>

if (root == NULL)<br>

{<br>

printf("Root is empty");<br>

return;<br>

}<br>

if (temp->left != NULL)<br>

inorder(temp->left);<br>

if (temp->right != NULL)<br>

inorder(t->right);<br>

}<br>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">64. Write the recursive C function to count the number of nodes present in a binary tree.</p>
					   <p class="ans">staticint counter = 0;<br>

intcountnodes(struct node *root)<br>

{<br>

if(root != NULL)<br>

{<br>

countnodes(root->left);<br>

counter++;<br>

countnodes(root->right);<br>

}<br>

return counter;<br>

}<br>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">65. Write a recursive C function to calculate the height of a binary tree.</p>
					   <p class="ans">To find the height using recursion, we find the maximum of the height of subtrees on the left and right sides and then add it with the root.<br> 
staticint counter = 0;<br>

intcountnodes(struct node *root)<br>

{<br>

if(root != NULL)<br>

{<br>

countnodes(root->left);<br>

countnodes(root->right);<br>

}<br>

return counter;<br>

                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">66. How is memory affected by signed and unsigned numbers?</p>
					   <p class="ans">For signed numbers, the first bit is reserved for indicating whether the number is positive or negative. Hence, it has one bit less for storing the value. Unlike signed numbers, unsigned numbers have all the bits available for storing the number.<br>
The effect of the aforementioned can be seen in the value range available to signed and unsigned numbers. While an unsigned 8-bit number can have a range of 0 to 255, an 8-bit signed number has a range varying from -128 to 127.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">67. Do all declaration statements result in a fixed memory reservation?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Except for pointers, all declaration statements result in a fixed memory reservation. Instead of allocating memory for storing data, a pointer declaration results in allocating memory for storing the address of the pointer variable.<br>
For pointers, actual memory allocation for the data happens during runtime.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">68. State some examples of both greedy and divide and conquer algorithms.</p>

					   <p class="qus">69. What do you understand by shell sort?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The shell sort can be understood as a variant of the insertion sort. The approach divides the entire list into smaller sub-lists based on some gap variable. Each sub-list is then sorted using insertion sort.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">70. Can you explain tree traversal?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The process for visiting all the nodes of a tree is called tree traversal. It always starts from the root node and there are three ways of doing it:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	In-order Traversal</li>
<li>●	Pre-order Traversal</li>
<li>●	Post-order Traversal</li>

                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">71. What is a spanning tree? What is the maximum number of spanning trees a graph can have?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A spanning tree is a subset of a graph that has all the vertices but with the minimum possible number of edges. A spanning tree cannot be disconnected and does not have cycles.<br>
The maximum number of spanning trees that a graph can have depends on how many connections there are. A complete undirected graph with n number of nodes can have a maximum of n-1 number of spanning trees.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">72. How does Kruskal's Algorithm work?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Kruskal’s algorithm treats a graph as a forest and each node in it as an individual tree. A tree connects to another tree only if it:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Has the least cost among all the available options</li>
<li>●	Does not violate MST properties</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">73. What is recursion?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The ability to allow a function or module to call itself is called recursion. Either a function f calls itself directly or calls another function ‘g’ that in turn calls the function ‘f. The function f is known as the recursive function and it follows recursive properties, which are:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Base criteria: Where the recursive function stops calling itself.</li>
<li>●	Progressive approach: Where the recursive function tries to meet the base criteria in each iteration.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">74. What is a heap?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A heap is a special balanced binary tree in which the root node key is compared with its children and arranged accordingly. It can be of two types:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Min-Heap: The parent node has a key value less than its children.</li>
<li>●	Max-Heap: The parent node has a key value greater than its children.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">75. What is the Tower of Hanoi problem?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that comprises three towers (or pegs) and more than one ring. Each ring is of varying size and stacked upon one another such that the larger one is beneath the smaller one.
The goal of the Tower of Hanoi problem is to move the tower of the disk from one peg to another without breaking the properties.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">76. What do you understand by hashing?</p>
					   <p class="ans">The technique of converting a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array is known as hashing. It is possible to create associative data storage using hash tables where data indices can be found by providing the corresponding key values.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">77. What is a Minimum Spanning Tree? How does Prim’s algorithm find it?</p>

					   <p class="qus">79. How do you check if the given Binary Tree is BST or not?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Simply perform an in order traversal of the given binary tree while keeping track of the previous key value. If the current key value is greater, then continue, otherwise return false. The binary tree is BST if the in order traversal of the binary tree is sorted.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">80. What is merge sort?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Merge sort, is a  divide-and-conquer approach for sorting the data. In a sequence of data, adjacent ones are merged and sorted to create bigger sorted lists. These sorted lists are then merged again to form an even bigger sorted list, which continues until you have one single sorted list.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">81. What is a linear search?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A linear search refers to the way a target key is being searched in a sequential data structure. In this method, each element in the list is checked and compared against the target key. The process is repeated until found or if the end of the file has been reached.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">82. Which sorting algorithm is considered the fastest?</p>
					   <p class="ans">There are many types of sorting algorithms: quick sort, bubble sort, balloon sort, radix sort, merge sort, etc. Not one can be considered the fastest because each algorithm is designed for a particular data structure and data set. It would depend on the data set that you would want to sort.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">83. What is a bubble sort and how do you perform it?</p>
					   <p class="ans">A bubble sort is one sorting technique that can be applied to data structures such as an array. It works by comparing adjacent elements and exchanges their values if they are out of order. This method lets the smaller values “bubble” to the top of the list, while the larger value sinks to the bottom.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">84. What are doubly linked lists?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Doubly linked lists are a special type of linked list wherein traversal across the data elements can be done in both directions. This is made possible by having two links in every node, one that links to the next node and another one that connects to the previous node.

					   <p class="qus">87. What is the method used for inorder traversal in trees?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Inorder traversal works in the following way:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	The tree is traversed through the left subtree.</li>
<li>●	The root node is visited after the left visit.</li>
<li>●	Then, the right subtree is traversed.</li>
</ol>
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">88. What is the working of post-order traversal in trees?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Postorder traversal works in the following way:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	First, the left subtree is traversed through.</li>
<li>●	The right subtree is traversed next.</li>
<li>●	The root node is visited after the right subtree visit.</li>

					   <p class="ans">There are two cases in which items can be placed in a circular queue. They are as follows:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	When front != 0 and rear = max -1. This makes it possible as the queue will not be full, and new elements can be inserted here.</li>
<li>●	When rear != max -1. This ensures that the rear is incremented to the maximum allocation size, and values can be inserted easily to the rear end of the queue.</li>

					   <p class="ans">Asymptotic analysis is the technique of determining an algorithm's running time in mathematical units to determine the program's limits, also known as "run-time performance." The purpose is to identify the best case, worst case, and average-case times for completing a particular activity. While not a deep learning training technique, Asymptotic analysis is an essential diagnostic tool for programmers to analyze an algorithm's efficiency rather than its correctness.
                       </p>
					   <p class="qus">93. What are asymptotic notations?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Asymptotic Notation represents an algorithm's running time - how long an algorithm takes with a given input, n. Big O, large Theta (), and big Omega () are the three distinct notations. When the running time is the same in all circumstances, big- is used, big-O for the worst-case running time, and big- for the best case running time.

					   <p class="qus">94. What are some examples of divide and conquer algorithms?</p>
					   <p class="ans">Quicksort is the name of a sorting algorithm. The method selects a pivot element and rearranges the array elements so that all items less than the pivot chosen element go to the left side of the pivot and all elements more significant than the pivot element move to the right side.<br>
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm as well. The algorithm divides the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then combines the two sorted halves. The goal of points that are closest together is to identify the nearest pair of points in an x-y plane collection of points. The issue may be solved in O(n2) time by computing the distances between each pair of locations and comparing them to determine the shortest distance.
