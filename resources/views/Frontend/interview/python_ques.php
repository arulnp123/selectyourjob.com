                      <p class="ans">we can make use of the edit mysite/setting.py command, which is a simple Python module that consists of levels for presenting or displaying Django settings.<br>
By default Django uses SQLite; this also makes it easy for Django users in case of any other type of installations. For example, if your database choice is different then you need to follow certain keys in the DATABASE like default items to match database connection settings.<br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>●	Engines: By these engines you change the database by using commands such as ‘django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2’, ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’, ‘django.db.backends.oracle’, ‘django.db.backends.mysql’, and so on.</li>
                        <li>●	Name: This represents the name of your own database. If you are familiar with using SQLite as your database, in such cases database is available as a file on your particular system. Moreover, the name should be as a fully absolute or exact path along with the file name of the particular file.</li>
                        <li>●	Suppose if we are not using SQLite as your database then additional settings such as password, user, the host must be added.</li>
                      </ul>
					  <p>Django mainly uses SQLite as its default database to store entire information in a single file of the filesystem. If you want to use different database servers rather than SQLite, then make use of database administration tools to create a new database for the Django project.  Another way is by using your own database in that place, and the remaining is to explain Django about how to use it. This is the place in which Python’s project settings.py file comes into the picture. <br>
We need to add the below code to the setting.py file:<br>
DATABASE  = {<br>
‘Default’ : {<br>
‘ENGINE’ :  ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’,<br>
‘NAME’ : os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ‘db.sqlite3’),<br>

                        <li>●	Proxy models: This style is mainly used for those who want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without modifying the model’s fields.</li>
                        <li>●	Abstract Base Classes: This inheritance style is used only when we want to make parent class hold the data which they don’t want to repeat again in the child class.</li>
                        <li>●	Multi-table Inheritance: This inheritance style is used only when we want to subclass an existing model and there must a database table designed for each model on its own.</li>

					  <p class="qus">87. What are the database connections in Python Flask, explain?</p>
                      <p class="ans">Database-powered applications are supported by the flask. The relational database systems need to create a schema that requires piping the schema.sql file into an SQLite3 command. So, in this case, you need to install the SQLite3 command on your system to initiate and create the database in the flask.<br>
We can request a database using flask in three ways, and they are:<br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>●	before_request(): Using this we can request database before only without passing arguments.</li>
                        <li>●	after_request(): This method is called after requesting the database and also send the response to the client.</li>
                        <li>●	teardown_request(): This method is called in the cases where the responses are not guaranteed and the exception is raised. They have no access to modify the request.</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>●	When a single instance fails, this will impact on larger load of the database server. The client makes the request when the data is reloaded. In order to avoid this, the code that you have written must be used to lower cache stampedes then it will be used to leave a minimal impact.</li>
                        <li>●	The other way is to bring out the instance of the Memcached on a new machine by using the IP address of the lost machine.</li>
                        <li>●	Another important option is to lower the server outages is code. This code provides you with the liberty to modify the Memcached server list with minimal work</li>
                      </ul>
					  <p>another way is by setting a timeout value that will be one of the options for memcac<br>

                        <li>●	hed clients to implement the Memcached server outage. When the performance of the server goes down, the client keeps on sending a request until the timeout limit is reached.</li>
                      </ul>
					  </p>
					  <p class="qus">89. What is the Dogpile effect?</p>
                      <p class="ans">This is defined as an occurrence of an event when the cache expires and also when the websites are hit with more requests by the client at a time. This dogpile effect can be averted by the use of a semaphore lock. If in the particular system the value expires then, first of all, the particular process receives the lock and begins generating new value.

					  <p class="qus">99. What is polymorphism in Python?</p>
                      <p class="ans">By using polymorphism in Python we will understand how to perform a single task in different ways. For example, designing a shape is the task and various possible ways in shapes are a triangle, rectangle, circle, and so on.
					  </p>
					  <p class="qus">100. Does Python make use of access specifiers?</p>
                      <p class="ans">Python does not make use of access specifiers and also it does not provide a way to access an instance variable. Python introduced a concept of prefixing the name of the method, function, or variable by using a double or single underscore to act like the behavior of private and protected access specifiers.
					  </p>
					  <p class="qus">101. How can we create an empty class in Python?</p>
                      <p class="ans">Empty class in Python is defined as a class that does not contain any code defined within the block. It can be created using pass keywords and object to this class can be created outside the class itself.<br>

					  <p class="qus">102. Define Constructor in Python?</p>
                      <p class="ans">Constructor is a special type of method with a block of code to initialize the state of instance members of the class. A constructor is called only when the instance of the object is created. It is also used to verify that they are sufficient resources for objects to perform a specific task.<br>
There are two types of constructors in Python, and they are:<br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>●	Parameterized constructor</li>

					  <p class="qus">107. How can you concatenate two tuples?</p>
                      <p class="ans">Solution -><br>
Let’s say we have two tuples like this -><br>
tup1 = (1,”a”,True)<br>
tup2 = (4,5,6)<br>
Concatenation of tuples means that we are adding the elements of one tuple at the end of another tuple.<br>
Now, let’s go ahead and concatenate tuple2 with tuple1:<br>
Code<br>
tup1=(1,"a",True)<br>
tup2=(4,5,6)<br>
tup1+tup2<br>

Output<br>
 
All you have to do is, use the ‘+’ operator between the two tuples and you’ll get the concatenated result.<br>
Similarly, let’s concatenate tuple1 with tuple2:<br>
Code<br>
tup1=(1,"a",True)<br>
tup2=(4,5,6)<br>
tup2+tup1<br>

                      <p class="ans">Two different data frames can be stacked either horizontally or vertically by the concat(), append() and join() functions in pandas.<br>
Concat works best when the dataframes have the same columns and can be used for concatenation of data having similar fields and is basically vertical stacking of dataframes into a single dataframe.<br>
Append() is used for horizontal stacking of dataframes. If two tables(dataframes) are to be merged together then this is the best concatenation function.<br>
Join is used when we need to extract data from different dataframes which are having one or more common columns. The stacking is horizontal in this case.<br>

					  <p class="qus">146. What are the built-in types does python provide?</p>
                      <p class="ans">Python has following built-in data types:<br>
Numbers: Python identifies three types of numbers:<br>
1.	Integer: All positive and negative numbers without a fractional part<br>
2.	Float: Any real number with floating-point representation<br>
3.	Complex numbers: A number with a real and imaginary component represented as x+yj. x and y are floats and j is -1(square root of -1 called an imaginary number)<br>
Boolean: The Boolean data type is a data type that has one of two possible values i.e. True or False. Note that ‘T’ and ‘F’ are capital letters.<br>
String: A string value is a collection of one or more characters put in single, double or triple quotes.<br>
List: A list object is an ordered collection of one or more data items which can be of different types, put in square brackets. A list is mutable and thus can be modified, we can add, edit or delete individual elements in a list.<br>
Set: An unordered collection of unique objects enclosed in curly brackets<br>
Frozen set: They are like a set but immutable, which means we cannot modify their values once they are created.<br>
Dictionary: A dictionary object is unordered in which there is a key associated with each value and we can access each value through its key. A collection of such pairs is enclosed in curly brackets. For example {‘First Name’ : ’Tom’ , ’last name’ : ’Hardy’} Note that Number values, strings, and tuple are immutable while as List or Dictionary object are mutable.

Code Explanation:<br> 
We start off by importing the insurance.csv file with this command:<br> 
df = pd.read_csv(‘insurance.csv’)<br> 
Then we go ahead and define the central limit theorem method:<br> 
def central_limit_theorem(data,n_samples = 1000, sample_size = 500, min_value = 0, max_value = 1338):<br> 
This method comprises of these parameters:<br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>●	Data</li>

						<li>●	Min_value</li>
						<li>●	Max_value</li>
                      </ul>
					  <p>Inside this method, we import all the required libraries:<br>
    import pandas as pd<br>
    import numpy as np<br>
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
    import seaborn as sns<br>
Then, we go ahead and create the first sub-plot for “Sampling distribution of bmi”:<br>

    sns.distplot(c.Mean)<br>
    plt.title(f”Sampling Distribution of bmi. \n \u03bc = {round(c.Mean.mean(), 3)} & SE = {round(c.Mean.std(),3)}”)<br>

    sns.distplot(data)<br>
    plt.title(f”population Distribution of bmi. \n \u03bc = {round(data.mean(), 3)} & \u03C3 = {round(data.std(),3)}”)<br>

                      <p class="ans">Below is the code to print out the 2-table:<br>
Code<br>
i=1<br>
n=2<br>
while i<=10:<br>
    print(n,"*", i, "=", n*i)<br>
    i=i+1<br>
Output<br>
We start off by initializing two variables ‘i’ and ‘n’. ‘i’ is initialized to 1 and ‘n’ is initialized to ‘2’.<br>
Inside the while loop, since the ‘i’ value goes from 1 to 10, the loop iterates 10 times.<br>
Initially n*i is equal to 2*1, and we print out the value.<br>
Then, ‘i’ value is incremented and n*i becomes 2*2. We go ahead and print it out.<br>
This process goes on until i value becomes 10.

					  <p class="qus">187. Write a function, which will take in a value and print out if it is even or odd.</p>
                      <p class="ans">The below code will do the job:<br>
def even_odd(x):<br>
    if x%2==0:<br>
        print(x," is even")<br>
    else:<br>
        print(x, " is odd")<br>
Here, we start off by creating a method, with the name ‘even_odd()’. This function takes a single parameter and prints out if the number taken is even or odd.<br>
Now, let’s invoke the function:<br>
even_odd(5)<br>
We see that, when 5 is passed as a parameter into the function, we get the output -> ‘5 is odd’.

					  <p class="qus">188. Write a python program to print the factorial of a number.</p>
                      <p class="ans">Below is the code to print the factorial of a number:<br>
factorial = 1<br>
#check if the number is negative, positive or zero<br>
if num<0:<br>
    print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")<br>
elif num==0:<br>
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")<br>
else<br>
    for i in range(1,num+1):<br>
        factorial = factorial*i<br>
    print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)<br>
We start off by taking an input which is stored in ‘num’. Then, we check if ‘num’ is less than zero and if it is actually less than 0, we print out ‘Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers’.<br>
After that, we check,if ‘num’ is equal to zero, and it that’s the case, we print out ‘The factorial of 0 is 1’.<br>
On the other hand, if ‘num’ is greater than 1, we enter the for loop and calculate the factorial of the number.
					  </p>
					  <p class="qus">189. Write a python program to check if the number given is a palindrome or not</p>
                      <p class="ans">Below is the code to Check whether the given number is palindrome or not:<br>
n=int(input("Enter number:"))<br>
temp=n<br>
rev=0<br>
while(n>0)<br>
    dig=n%10<br>
    rev=rev*10+dig<br>
    n=n//10<br>
if(temp==rev):<br>
    print("The number is a palindrome!")<br>
else:<br>
    print("The number isn't a palindrome!")<br>
We will start off by taking an input and store it in ‘n’ and make a duplicate of it in ‘temp’. We will also initialize another variable ‘rev’ to 0. <br>
Then, we will enter a while loop which will go on until ‘n’ becomes 0.<br> 
Inside the loop, we will start off by dividing ‘n’ with 10 and then store the remainder in ‘dig’.<br>
Then, we will multiply ‘rev’ with 10 and then add ‘dig’ to it. This result will be stored back in ‘rev’.<br>
Going ahead, we will divide ‘n’ by 10 and store the result back in ‘n’<br>
Once the for loop ends, we will compare the values of ‘rev’ and ‘temp’. If they are equal, we will print ‘The number is a palindrome’, else we will print ‘The number isn’t a palindrome’.
