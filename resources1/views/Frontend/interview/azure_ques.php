</p>
<p class="qus">64. What are the different storage services available in Azure apart from Blob storage?</p>
<p class="ans">Azure offers three other types of storage services, apart from Blob storage, table storage, queue Storage, and file storage.<br>
<img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/storage.png" style="width:800px;" /><br>
<ol>
<li>●	Azure table storage: It allows the deployment of applications with semi-structured data and a key-value store, which is NoSQL-based.</li>
<li>○	Used when there is a requirement for applications with a flexible data schema</li>
<li>○	Emphasis is on enterprise-level data and strongly follows consistent models</li>
<li>○	Data is in terms of entities grouped under tables</li>
<li>●	Azure queue storage: The message queue system is capable of handling large workloads through the development of flexible and durable applications.</li>
<li>○	Ensures that the applications are scalable and less likely to have component failures</li>
<li>○	The queue monitoring helps the application ensure that the requirements are met</li>
<li>●	Azure file storage: It offers file sharing and access using server message block (SMB) protocol. The data is secured with SMB 3.0 and HTTPS.</li>
<li>○	Improves the performance of on-premise applications</li>

</ol>
</p>
<p class="qus">70. How can you stop the high load issue on an application in cases of no man support on the flow?</p>
<p class="ans">Azure VM Scale Sets can be used to define proper configurations and conditions and provide a new VM whenever there is a high load.<br>
The VM Scale Sets allows the developer to create and manage a group of load-balanced VMs. The scale sets can be configured in accordance with the demand of the application or a predefined schedule that automatically adjusts the number of VMs.<br>
Using scale sets ensures that the applications are highly available and enable the management, updation, and configuration of large VMs centrally. It also supports large-scale application development with big workloads, big data, and compute loads. Azure Scale Sets supports up to 1,000 VMs and 600 VMs for custom VM images.

<p class="qus">71. What would happen if tone reaches the maximum failed attempts for Azure ID authentication?</p>
<p class="ans">In this situation, the Azure account will get locked depending on the protocol analyzing the entered password and the IP address from where the login is requested.
</p>
<p class="qus">72. If you have an application running on the on-premise server and Azure East US region has a backup, will you be able to access the application via the Azure environment in case of an on-premise server application access failure?</p>
<p class="ans">Yes. One can access the application by using the Site Recovery Service by Azure. It is capable of handling fail-over and fail-back scenarios between on-premise servers and Azure environments.
</p>
<p class="qus">73. In case the front-end hosting of an application is done on Azure, if the user needs the database hosting to be done on an on-premise server due to security concerns, how will you handle the Azure connectivity?</p>
<p class="ans">There are a few possibilities to resolve this:<br>
<ol>
<li>●	Azure VNET based point-to-site service can be used to connect one on-premise DB to an Azure-hosted application. This is valid where there are limited resources to be connected via VPN.</li>
<li>●	In case of more resources for connection, site to site or express routes are the solution. Site to site might cause network latency as the VPN works only via public infrastructure, which is the internet. In that case, express routes can be used as it has a dedicated leased line that solves latency issues.</li>
<li>●	In case VNET is not preferred, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service can be developed and hosted on-premise. It will have CRUD operations intended solely for the database that is hosted on-premise. It uses the service bus relay that can build communication between the Azure-hosted app to the WCF service for database access.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="qus">74. You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Log Analytics workspace. You have a resource group that contains 100 virtual machines. The virtual machines run Linux. You need to collect events from the virtual machines to the log analytics workspace. Which type of data source should be configured in the workspace?</p>
<p class="ans">The answer is Syslog, which is an event logging protocol that is common to Linux. Applications will send messages that may be stored on the local machine or delivered to a Syslog collector. When the log analytics agent for Linux is installed, it configures the local Syslog daemon to forward messages to the agent. The agent then sends the message to Azure Monitor where a corresponding record is created.
</p>
<p class="qus">75. You create a container image named Image1 on a developer workstation. You plan to create an Azure web app for containers named WebAppContainer that will use Image1. You need to upload Image1 to Azure. The solution must ensure that WebAppContainer can use Image1. To which storage type should you upload Image1?</p>
<p class="ans">Image1 should be uploaded to the Azure container registry. The registry credentials are configured in the web app. App service needs information about the registry and image to pull the private image. In the Azure portal, go to Container settings from the web app and update the Image source, Registry, and Save.
</p>
<p class="qus">76. You have an Azure subscription that contains 100 virtual machines. You have a set of Pester tests in PowerShell that validate the virtual machine environment. You need to run the tests whenever there is an operating system update on the virtual machines. The solution must minimize implementation time and recurring costs. Which three resources should you use to implement the tests?</p>
<p class="ans">The three resources to use to implement the test are the Azure Automation runbook, an alert rule, and an alert action group. Azure Automation runbooks can be called by using action groups or by using classic alerts to automate tasks based on alerts. Alerts are one of the key features of Azure Monitor. They allow alerts on actions within an Azure subscription.
</p>
<p class="qus">77. You have an Azure App Service app. You need to implement tracing for the app. The tracing information must include the following:</p>

<p class="qus">82. You have an Azure Cosmos DB account named Account1. Account1 includes a database named DB1 that contains a container named Container1. The partition key for Container1 is set to /city. You plan to change the partition key for Container1. What should you do first?</p>
<p class="ans">The Change Feed Processor and Bulk Executor Library, in Azure Cosmos DB, can be leveraged to achieve a live migration of data from one container to another. This allows the redistribution of data to match the desired new partition key scheme and make the relevant application changes afterward. Thus, achieving the effect of updating your partition key.
</p>
<p class="qus">83.You have an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1. RG1 contains multiple resources. You need to trigger an alert when the resources in RG1 consume US$1,000. What should you do?</p>
<p class="ans">Budgets should be created to manage costs and alerts should be set to automatically notify if stakeholders are overspending. To set it up, one should go to the Azure Portal, select Cost Management + Billing -> Cost Management -> Go to Cost Management.
</p>
<p class="qus">84.You have an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster named Clus1 in a resource group named RG1. An administrator plans to manage Clus1 from an Azure AD-joined device.

							</tr>
						  </tbody>
						</table>
						<p class="qus">88.You need to route all internet-bound traffic from Subnet1 to the Seattle office. What should you create?</p>
						<p class="ans">A route for Subnet1 that uses the virtual network gateway as the next hop should be created. A route with the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix instructs Azure how to route traffic destined for an IP address that is not within the address prefix of any other route in a subnet’s route table.<br> 
When a subnet is created, Azure creates a default route to the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix, with the internet next hop type. We need to create a custom route in Azure to use a virtual network gateway in the Seattle office as the next hop.
</p>
<p class="qus">89.You have an Azure web app named App1 that is configured to run between two and five instances. There are currently three instances of App1 running. App1 has the following autoscale rules: Increase the instance count by one when the CPU percentage is greater or equal to 80. Decrease the instance count by one when the CPU percentage is less than or equal to 60. You are evaluating the following CPU percentage of utilization for App1:</p>
<p class="ans">●	60 percent<br>
●	55 percent<br>
●	50 percent<br>
●	45 percent<br>
</p>
<p class="qus">90.You need to identify which utilizations will cause App1 to scale in.</p>
<p class="ans">Azure Monitor autoscaling allows you to scale the number of running instances up or down, based on telemetry data or metrics. Scale-in occurs when the instances are decreased. For this rule, the instances are decreased when the CPU usage is 60 percent or lower. Hence, the answer is 45 percent, 50 percent, and 55 percent.
</p>
<p class="qus">91.You have an on-premises network that contains a Hyper-V host named Host1. Host1 runs Windows Server 2016 and hosts 10 virtual machines that run Windows Server 2016.

<p class="ans">In this case, a VPN connection should be set up.
</p>
<p class="qus">95.You have a resource group named RG1. RG1 contains an Azure Storage account named storageaccount1 and a virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server 2016. storageaccount1 contains the disk files for VM1. You apply a ReadOnly lock to RG1. What can you do from the Azure portal?</p>
<p class="ans">View the keys of storageaccount1. ReadOnly allows authorized users to read a resource, but they cannot delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the reader role.
</p>
<p class="qus">96.What do you understand about cloud computing?</p>
<p class="ans"><ol><li>●	Cloud computing refers to the usage of computing resources (servers) on the internet (refers to the term cloud) for the purpose of storing, managing, analyzing, and processing the data. Here, instead of maintaining our own servers, we use the infrastructure provided and maintained by third-party vendors such as Microsoft, AWS, etc, and pay them based on the server usage time duration.</li>
<li>●	Cloud computing enhances the speed of execution, ensures flexibility of resources, and easier scalability.</li>
<li>●	Cloud computing can be used to attain high fault tolerance and high system availability and this can also be done dynamically as per the infrastructural requirements of the application.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="qus">97. What are the various models available for cloud deployment?</p>
<p class="ans">There are 3 models available for cloud deployment:<br>
<img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/cloud.jpg" style="width:300px;"/><br>
<ol>
<li>●	Public Cloud: In this model, the cloud infrastructure is owned publicly by the cloud provider and there are chances that the server resources could be shared between multiple applications.</li>
<li>●	Private Cloud: Here, the cloud infrastructure is owned exclusively by us or exclusive service is provided by the cloud provider to us.</li>
<li>○	This includes hosting our applications on our own on-premise servers or hosting the application on a dedicated server provided by the cloud provider.</li>
<li>●	Hybrid Cloud: As the name itself says, this model is the hybrid combination of private cloud and the public cloud.</li>
<li>○	This might include the scenario of using on-premise servers for processing confidential, sensitive data and using public cloud features for hosting public-facing applications.</li>
</ol>
<img src="<?= base_url(); ?>assets/img/cloud2.jpg" style="width:400px;"/><br>
</p>
<p class="qus">98. What is NSG?</p>
<p class="ans">NSG stands for Network Security Group that has a list of ACL (Access Control List) rules which either allows/denies network traffic to subnets or NICs (Network Interface Card) connected to a subnet or both. When NSG is linked with a subnet, then the ACL rules are applied to all the Virtual Machines in that subnet.
</p>
<p class="qus">99. What do you understand about the “Availability Set”?</p>
<p class="ans">
<ol>
<li>●	Availability Set is nothing but a logical grouping of VMs (Virtual Machines) that allows Azure cloud to understand how the application was developed for providing availability and redundancy.</li>
<li>●	Each VM in the availability set is assigned 2 kinds of domains by Azure:</li>
<li>○	Fault Domain: These define the grouping of VMs that would share a common power source and common network switch. The VMs within availability sets are separated across up to 3 fault domains by default. This separation of VMs in fault domains helps our applications to be available by reducing impacts of network outages, power interruptions, and certain hardware failures.</li>
<li>○	Update Domain: These indicate the grouping of VMs and underlying hardware which are eligible to be rebooted at the same time. Only one update domain can be rebooted at a time, however, the order of reboot does not proceed in a sequential manner. Before the maintenance of another update domain, the previously rebooted domain is given a recovery time of 30 minutes to ensure that the domain is up.</li>
<li>●	Azure provides flexibility to configure up to 3 fault domains and 20 update domains for an availability set.</li>
