						<p class="qus">98) What needs to be done to ensure the program executes above 16 Meg Line?</p>
						<p class="ans">We need to do the following steps:<br>
<ul>
<li>●	Ensure the link option is set to AMODE=31 and RMODE=ANY.</li>
<li>●	Compile option does not have SIZE(MAX).</li>
<li>●	For efficiency, BUFSIZE can be 2K.</li>
</ul>

						<p class="qus">99) What is the importance of coding COMMITS in batch programs?</p>
						<p class="ans">COMMIT statements are used for releasing locks that are needed for that particular work unit and then allow new work units. In case, COMMITS are not part of the program, then during processing of the program, it has to go back to the inserts that were made during the program run instead of going back to few inserts near the most recent commit. This process takes 2 or 3 times extra time than the time taken for program execution.

						<p class="qus">100) How does paging work in the memory?</p>
						<p class="ans">Whenever data is requested from the memory, the CPU first hits the primary memory, i.e RAM, and checks if the requested data is present on that page in the memory. If it is not present, then the CPU performs paging on secondary memory, i.e reads data from hard disk in equal blocks of memories called pages. During paging, a frame constitutes a single page of physical memory and it need not be physically contiguous. This ensures faster memory access and ensures data is fetched faster from secondary memory.

						<p class="qus">101) In case you have 1000 rows in the DB2 table, how will you update the column value of the first 100 records?</p>
						<p class="ans">In case our DB2 table has an identity column, then we can use the indexnum as follows:<br>
Update Table SET COLUMN_NAME=XXX where indexnum < 101
						</p>
						<p class="qus">102) Is it possible to redefine X(100) field with X(200)? If yes, how?</p>
						<p class="ans">Yes, it is possible by making use of REDEFINES. We need to keep in mind that redefining just ensures fields start from the same location.<br>
01 WS-TOP PIC X(100)<br>
01 WS-TOP-DOUBLE REDEFINES WS-TOP PIC X(200)

						<p class="qus">103) How will you copy data from one dataset to another dataset by using the SORT card?</p>
						<p class="ans">We can mention SYSIN and SYSOUT dataset names in the SORT step. Additionally, we need to mention SORT FIELDS = COPY in the sort card to copy data from one dataset to another.
						</p>
						<p class="qus">104) How will you inform other users about job completion?</p>
						<p class="ans">We can make use of NOTIFY statement which notifies the user about job completion along with the return code.<br>
NOTIFY = userid to whom status needs to be notified<br>
It has to be noted that the job log of the spool would contain information under the job submitter’s id.
						</p>
						<p class="qus">105) How will you achieve auto restart when the job abends?</p>
						<p class="ans">We can make use of the RD parameter in JOB/EXEC statement by specifying for what abend codes RESTART needs to be performed in the SCHEDxx member of parmlib library of the IBM system
