<h3 class="h3">1) What is Python?</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/python-interview-questions.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" class="imageright" />
<p>Python was made by Guido van Rossum and delivered in 1991.</p>
<p>It is a programming language for computers of all kinds. It is an object-oriented high-level language that works equally well on Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh. its built-in high-level data structures, as well as dynamic binding and typing. It is generally utilized in information science, AI and man-made consciousness area.</p>

<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/advantages-of-python.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is PEP 8?</h3>
<p>The Python Enhancement Proposal, also known as PEP 8, is a document that provides instructions on how to write Python code. In essence, it is a set of guidelines for formatting Python code for maximum readability. Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan wrote it in 2001.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">6) What do you mean by Python literals?</h3>
<p>Literals can be defined as a data which is given in a variable or constant. Python supports the following literals:</p>
<p><strong>String Literals</strong></p>
<p>Text can be enclosed in either single or double quotes to create string literals. String literals, for instance, are values for strings.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">7) Describe the Python Functions?</h3>
<p>A function is a piece of code that is only written once and can be executed whenever the program calls for it. A function is a self-contained block of statements with a valid name, list of parameters, and body. Capabilities make programming more practical and particular to perform measured assignments. There are a number of built-in functions for completing tasks in Python, and the user can also create new functions.</p>
<p>Functions fall into three categories:</p>
<p>Built-In Functions: duplicate(), len(), count() are the a few implicit capabilities.</p>
<p>User-defined Functions: User-defined functions are functions that are defined by a user.</p>
<p>Anonymous functions: Because they are not declared using the standard def keyword, these functions are also referred to as lambda functions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A general syntax of user defined function is given below.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">8) What is zip() capability in Python?</h3>
<p>The zip() function in Python returns a zip object that maps an identical index across multiple containers. It takes an iterable, transforms it into an iterator, and then uses the passed iterables to combine the elements. It returns a tuple iterator.</p>
<p>Signature zip(iterator1, iterator2, iterator3, etc.) Parameters iterator1, iterator2, and iterator3: These are joined-together iterator objects.</p>
<p>Return It returns a iterator that is the product of two or more iterators.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: When the first list ends, zip stops making tuples if the given lists have different lengths. This indicates that two lists have three lengths, and a triple of five lengths will result.</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">9) What is Python's paramter passing system?</h3>
<p>In Python, there are two mechanisms for passing parameters:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Pass by references</li>
<li>Pass by value</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, all arguments (parameters) are passed to the functions "by reference." In this manner, in the event that you change the worth of the boundary inside a capability, the change is reflected in the calling capability too. It shows the first factor. For instance, if a variable is passed to a function with the declaration "a = 10" and its value is changed to "a = 20," The same value is represented by both variables.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/python-parameter-passing-mechanism.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<p>The pass by esteem is that at whatever point we pass the contentions to the capability just qualities pass to the capability, no reference passes to the capability. It makes it unchangeable, or immutable. The original value of either variable remains the same despite being modified in the function.</p>
<p>Python has a default contention idea which assists with calling a technique utilizing an erratic number of contentions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">10) In Python, how do you overload methods or constructors?</h3>
<p>The constructor of Python: _ A class's init__ () method is the first one. Python automatically calls __init__() to initialize object members whenever we attempt to instantiate an object. In Python, we can't overload constructors or methods. If we attempt to overload, it displays an error.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
class student:  
    def __init__(self, name):  
        self.name = name  
    def __init__(self, name, email):  
        self.name = name  
        self.email = email  
       
# This line will generate an error  
#st = student("rahul")  
  
# This line will call the second constructor  
st = student("rahul", "rahul@gmail.com")  
print("Name: ", st.name)
print("Email id: ", st.email)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Name:  rahul
Email id:  <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2b594a435e476b4c464a424705484446">[email&#160;protected]</a>
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is the difference between remove() function and del statement?</h3>
<p>The user can use the remove() function to delete a specific object in the list.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
list_1 = [ 3, 5, 7, 3, 9, 3 ] 
print(list_1)
list_1.remove(3) 
print("After removal: ", list_1)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
[3, 5, 7, 3, 9, 3]
After removal: [5, 7, 3, 9, 3]
</pre></div>
<p>If you want to delete an object at a specific location (index) in the list, you can either use <strong>del</strong> or <strong>pop</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
list_1 = [ 3, 5, 7, 3, 9, 3 ] 
print(list_1)
del list_1[2]
print("After deleting: ", list_1)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
[3, 5, 7, 3, 9, 3]
After deleting: [3, 5, 3, 9, 3]
</pre></div>

<p>We cannot use these methods with a tuple because the tuple is different from the list.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">12) What is swapcase() function in the Python?</h3>
<p>The function of a string is to change all uppercase characters into lowercase ones and vice versa. Modifying the current instance of the string is utilized. All the characters in the swap case are copied in this method's string. A small case string is produced when the string is in lowercase, and vice versa. It automatically disregards all characters that are not alphabetical. See an example below:</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
string = "IT IS IN LOWERCASE."
print(string.swapcase())

string = "it is in uppercase."
print(string.swapcase())
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
it is in lowercase. 
IT IS IN UPPERCASE. 
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">13) How to remove whitespaces from a string in Python?</h3>
<p>To eliminate the whitespaces and following spaces from the string, Python provides strip([str]) worked in capability. After removing any whitespaces that may be present, this function returns a copy of the string. If not, returns the original string.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
string = "  javatpoint "
string2 = "    javatpoint        "
string3 = "       javatpoint"
print(string)
print(string2)
print(string3)
print("After stripping all have placed in a sequence:")
print(string.strip())
print(string2.strip())
print(string3.strip())
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
javatpoint 
    javatpoint        
       javatpoint
After stripping all have placed in a sequence:
Javatpoint
javatpoint
javatpoint
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">14) How to remove leading whitespaces from a string in the Python?</h3>
<p>We can make use of the lstrip() function to get rid of leading characters from a string. It is a Python string function with an optional parameter of the char type. In the event that a boundary is given, it eliminates the person. Otherwise, it strips the string of all leading spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
string = "  javatpoint " 
string2 = "    javatpoint        "
print(string)
print(string2)
print("After stripping all leading whitespaces:")
print(string.lstrip())
print(string2.lstrip())
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
javatpoint 
    javatpoint        
After stripping all leading whitespaces:
javatpoint 
javatpoint
</pre></div>
<br>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/remove-leading-whitespaces.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<p>After stripping, all the whitespaces are removed, and now the string looks like the below:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/remove-leading-whitespaces2.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">15) Why do we use join() function in Python?</h3>
<p>The join() is defined as a string method which returns a string value. It is concatenated with the elements of an iterable. It provides a flexible way to concatenate the strings. See an example below.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
str = "Rohan"
str2 = "ab"
# Calling function  
str2 = str.join(str2)  
# Displaying result  
print(str2)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
aRohanb
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">16) Give an example of shuffle() method?</h3>
<p>The given string or array is shuffled using this technique. The items in the array become random as a result. The random module includes this method. Therefore, we must import it before calling the function. It rearranges components each time when the capability calls and creates different result.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# import the random module
import random
# declare a list
sample_list1 = ['Z', 'Y', 'X', 'W', 'V', 'U']
print("Original LIST1: ")
print(sample_list1)
# first shuffle 
random.shuffle(sample_list1)
print("\nAfter the first shuffle of LIST1: ")
print(sample_list1)
# second shuffle
random.shuffle(sample_list1)
print("\nAfter the second shuffle of LIST1: ")
print(sample_list1)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Original LIST1: 
['Z', 'Y', 'X', 'W', 'V', 'U']

After the first shuffle of LIST1: 
['V', 'U', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']

After the second shuffle of LIST1: 
['Z', 'Y', 'X', 'U', 'V', 'W']
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is the use of break statement?</h3>
<p>The break statement is utilized to end the execution of the ongoing loop. Break always terminates the current execution and transfers control to a block outside of it. If the break is in a nested loop, it exits from the innermost loop. If the block is in a loop, it exits from the loop.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
list_1 = ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
list_2 = [11, 22, 33]
for i in list_1:
    for j in list_2:
        print(i, j)
        if i == 'Y' and j == 33:
            print('BREAK')
            break
    else:
        continue
    break
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
2
X 11
X 22
X 33
Y 11
Y 22
Y 33
BREAK
</pre></div>

<p>Python Break statement flowchart.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">18) What is tuple in Python?</h3>
<p>A built-in type of data collection is the tuple. It permits us to store values in a grouping. Because it cannot be changed, the original data do not reflect any changes. A tuple is created with () brackets rather than [] square brackets. We are unable to remove any element, but we can locate it in the tuple. Indexing allows us to obtain elements. It likewise permits navigating components in switch request by utilizing negative ordering. There are a variety of Tuple methods, including Len(), max(), sum(), and sorted().</p>
<p>To create a tuple, we can declare it as below.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# Declaring tuple
tup = (2,4,6,8)
# Displaying value
print(tup)

# Displaying Single value
print(tup[2])
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
(2, 4, 6, 8)
6
</pre></div>
<br>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/tuple-in-python.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<p>It is immutable. So updating tuple will lead to an error.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# Declaring tuple
tup = (2,4,6,8)
# Displaying value
print(tup)

# Displaying Single value
print(tup[2])

# Updating by assigning new value
tup[2]=22
# Displaying Single value
print(tup[2])
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
tup[2]=22 
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment 
(2, 4, 6, 8)
</pre></div>
<br>

<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">19) Which are the file related libraries/modules in Python?</h3>
<p>You can manipulate binary and text files on the file system with the help of Python's libraries and modules. It makes it easier to create, edit, copy, and delete files.</p>
<p>The libraries are os, os.path, and shutil. Here, os and os.path - modules include a function for accessing the filesystem, while shutil - module enables you to copy and delete the files.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">20) What are the different file processing modes supported by Python?</h3>
<p>There are four ways to open files in Python. The read-write (rw), write-only (w), append (a), and read-only (r) modes. 'r' is used to open a file in read-only mode; 'w' is used to open a file in write-only mode; 'rw' is used to open in both read-only and write-only modes; and 'a' is used to open a file in append mode. In the event that the mode isn't determined, of course document opens in read-just mode.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Read-only (r) mode: Read a file by opening it. It's the default setting.</li>
<li>Only write mode (w): Open a document for composing. On the off chance that the record contains information, information would be lost. A brand-new file is also created.</li>
<li>Read-Write (rw) mode: In write mode, open a file for reading. It implies refreshing mode.</li>
<li>Addition mode (a): If the file exists, open it for writing and append it to the end.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">21) What is an operator in Python?</h3>
<p>An operator is a specific symbol that is applied to some values and results in an output. Operands are the work of an operator. Operands are literals or variables with numbers that have some values. Administrators can be unary, double, or ternary. A ternary operator, a binary operator, a ternary operator, and a unary operator are all examples of operators that require three or more operands, respectively.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/operator-in-python.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# Unary Operator
A = 12
B = -(A)
print (B)
# Binary Operator
A = 12
B = 13
print (A + B)
print (B * A)
#Ternary Operator
A = 12
B = 13
min = A if A < B else B
  
print(min)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
# Unary Operator
-12
# Binary Operator
25
156
# Ternary Operator
12
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">22) What are the different types of operators in Python?</h3>
<p>Numerous operations can be carried out with Python's extensive set of operators. A few individual administrators like membership and identity operators are not all that recognizable yet permit to perform operations.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Arithmetic OperatorsRelational Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Membership Operators</li>
<li>Identity Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/python-operators.png" alt="Python Operator Interview Questions" />
<p><strong>Arithmetic operators</strong> perform basic arithmetic operations. For example "+" is used to add and "?" is used for subtraction.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# Adding two values
print(12+23)
# Subtracting two values
print(12-23)
# Multiplying two values
print(12*23)
# Dividing two values
print(12/23)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
35
-11
276
0.5217391304347826
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Relational Operators</strong> are used to comparing the values. These operators test the conditions and then returns a boolean value either True or False.</p>
<p># Examples of Relational Operators</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
a, b = 10, 12
print(a==b) # False
print(a&lt;b) # True
print(a&lt;=b) # True
print(a!=b) # True
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
False
True
True
True
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Assignment operators</strong> are used to assigning values to the variables. See the examples below.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# Examples of Assignment operators
a=12
print(a) # 12
a += 2
print(a) # 14
a -= 2
print(a) # 12
a *=2
print(a) # 24
a **=2
print(a) # 576
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
12
14
12
24
576
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Logical operators</strong> are used to performing logical operations like And, Or, and Not. See the example below.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# Logical operator examples
a = True
b = False
print(a and b) # False
print(a or b) # True
print(not b) # True
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
False
True
True
</pre></div>
<p>Participation administrators are accustomed to checking whether a component is an individual from the grouping (list, word reference, tuples) or not. To verify an element's presence, Python employs the in and not in operators, two membership operators. See a example:</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">

<h3 class="h3">24) is Python interpreted language?</h3>
<p>Python is a language that is interpreted. From the source code, the Python program runs directly. It turns the source code into intermediate language code, which is then again translated into machine language that needs to be run.</p>
<p>Python does not require compilation before running, unlike Java and C.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/python-interpreted-language.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">25) How is memory managed in Python?</h3>
<p>Memory is managed in Python in the following ways:</p>
<p>Private heap space in Python handles memory management. All Python items and information structures are situated in a confidential stack. The developer doesn't approach this private load. This is handled by the Python interpreter instead.</p>
<p>The memory manager in Python is responsible for allocating heap space to Python objects. The core API grants the programmer access to some coding tools.</p>
<p>Additionally, Python has a built-in garbage collector that recycles all unused memory and makes it available to the heap space.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">26) What is the Python decorator?</h3>
<p>Decorators are a useful Python tool that allows programmers to add functionality to existing code. They are very powerful. Because a component of the program attempts to modify another component at compile time, this is also known as metaprogramming. It permits the client to wrap one more capability to expand the way of behaving of the wrapped capability, without forever changing it.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
def function_is_called():
    def function_is_returned():
        print("JavaTpoint")
    return function_is_returned
new_1 = function_is_called()
# Outputs "JavaTpoint"
new_1()
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
JavaTpoint
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Functions vs. Decorators</strong></p>
<p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task whereas a decorator is a function that modifies other functions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">27) What are the rules for a local and global variable in Python?</h3>
<p><strong>Global Variables:</strong></p>
<p>Variables declared outside a function or in global space are called global variables.</p>
<p>We must explicitly declare a variable as "global" whenever a new value is given to it within the function because it is implicitly local. The global keyword must be used to declare a variable in order to make it global.</p>
<p>Any function can access and alter the value of global variables, which are accessible anywhere in the program.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
A = "JavaTpoint"
def my_function():
  print(A)
my_function()
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
JavaTpoint
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Local Variables:</strong></p>
<p>A local variable is any variable declared within a function. The local space, not the global space, contains this variable.</p>
<p>In the event that a variable is relegated another worth anyplace inside the capability's body, being a local is expected.</p>
<p>Only the local body can access local variables.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
def my_function2():
    K = "JavaTpoint Local"
    print(K)
my_function2() 
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
JavaTpoint Local
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">28) What is the namespace in Python?</h3>
<p>The namespace is a fundamental concept for organizing and structuring code that is more useful in large projects. However, if you're new to programming, it might be a little hard to understand. Subsequently, we attempted to make namespaces somewhat more obvious.</p>
<p>A namespace is characterized as a basic framework to control the names in a program. It ensures that there will be no conflict and that each name will be unique.</p>
<p>Additionally, Python executes namespaces as word references and keeps up with name-to-protest planning where names go about as keys and the articles as values.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">29) What are iterators in Python?</h3>
<p>Iterating a collection of elements, similar to a list, in Python is accomplished with iterators. Iterators can be lists, tuples, or dictionaries-the collection of items. To iterate over the stored elements, Python iterator uses the __itr__ and next() methods. In Python, we for the most part use circles to emphasize over the assortments (list, tuple).</p>
<p>Simply stated: Iterators are objects which can be crossed however or iterated upon.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">30) What is a generator in Python?</h3>
<p>In Python, the generator is a way that determines how to execute iterators. Except for the fact that it produces expression in the function, it is a normal function. It eliminates the __itr__ and next() methods and reduces additional overheads.</p>
<p>On the off chance that a capability contains essentially a yield explanation, it turns into a generator. By saving its states, the yield keyword pauses the current execution and allows it to be resumed whenever necessary.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">31) What is slicing in Python?</h3>
<p>Slicing is a system used to choose a scope of things from succession type like rundown, tuple, and string. Getting components from a reach by utilizing slice way is valuable and simple. It requires a : ( colon) what isolates the beginning and end record of the field. Slicing is supported by all data collection types, including List and tuples. Using slicing, we can get a group of elements, whereas by specifying an index, we can only get one element.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/slicing-in-python.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
Q = "JavaTpoint, Python Interview Questions!"
print(Q[2:25])
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
vaTpoint, Python Interv
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">32) What is a dictionary in Python?</h3>
<p>A built-in data type is the Python dictionary. A one-to-one relationship between keys and values is established by this. A pair of keys and their values are contained in dictionaries. It stores components in key and worth matches. Values can be duplicated, whereas keys are unique. The dictionary elements are accessed by the key.</p>
<p>Keys index dictionaries.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>The following example contains some keys Country Hero & Cartoon. Their corresponding values are India, Modi, and Rahul respectively.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
dict = {'Country': 'India', 'Hero': 'Modi', 'Cartoon': 'Rahul'}
print ("Country: ", dict['Country'])  
print ("Hero: ", dict['Hero'])
print ("Cartoon: ", dict['Cartoon'])
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Country:  India
Hero:  Modi
Cartoon:  Rahul
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">33) What is Pass in Python?</h3>
<p>Pass specifies an operation-free Python statement. It is in a compound statement as a placeholder. To make a vacant class or works, the pass catchphrase assists with passing the control without error.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
class Student: 
    pass # Passing class  
class Student:  
    def info():
        pass # Passing function
</textarea></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">34) Explain docstring in Python?</h3>
<p>The first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition is the Python docstring, a string literal. It makes it easier to link the documents together.</p>
<p>"Attribute docstrings" are string literals that occur immediately after a straightforward assignment at the top.</p>
<p>"Additional docstrings" are string literals that occur immediately after another docstring.</p>
<p>Despite fitting on a single line, docstrings are created by Python using triple quotes.</p>
<p>The phrase in docstring ends with a period (.) and may include several lines. It may include special characters like spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
# One-line docstrings
def hello():
    """A function to greet."""
    return "hello"
</textarea></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">35) What is a negative index in Python and why are they used?</h3>
<p>Python's sequences are indexed and contain both positive and negative numbers. The numbers that are positive purposes '0' that is utilizes as first record and '1' as the subsequent file and the cycle go on that way.</p>
<p>The negative number's index begins with '-1,' which denotes the sequence's final index, and ends with '-2,' which denotes the sequence's penultimate index.</p>
<p>The negative index is used to get rid of any new-line spaces in a string and make it possible for the string to contain all but the last character, S[:-1]. The negative index is also used to show the correct order in which the index represents the string.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">36) What is pickling and unpickling in Python?</h3>
<p>A module known as the Python pickle is one that transforms any Python object into a string representation. Utilizing the dump function, it copies the Python object to a file; this cycle is called Pickling.</p>
<p>Unpickling is the procedure of obtaining the original Python objects from the stored string representation.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">37) Which programming language is a good choice between Java and Python?</h3>
<p>Java and Python both are object-oriented programming languages. Let's compare both on some criteria given below:</p>

<p>Help() and dir() the two capabilities are open from the Python mediator and utilized for review a united dump of implicit capabilities.</p>
<p>Function "help()": The help() function enables us to view module, keyword, and attribute-related help in addition to displaying the documentation string.</p>
<p>The Dir() method: The defined symbols are displayed using the dir() function.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">39) What are the differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x?</h3>
<p>Python 2.x is a previous version. Python 3.x is the most recent release. Python 2.x is inheritance now. This language is both now and in the future Python 3.x.</p>
<p>The most noticeable contrast somewhere in the range of Python2 and Python3 is on paper explanation (capability). It looks like print "Hello" in Python 2, and it looks like print ("Hello") in Python 3.</p>
<p>String in Python2 is ASCII verifiably, and in Python3 it is Unicode.</p>
<p>The xrange() technique has eliminated from Python 3 variant. Error handling introduces a brand-new keyword.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">40) How Python does Compile-time and Run-time code checking?</h3>
<p>The majority of the checking for things like type, name, and so on is done at compile time in Python. are deferred until code execution. As a result, the Python code will compile successfully if it refers to a user-defined function that does not exist. With one exception, the Python code will fail when the execution path is missing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">41) What is the shortest method to open a text file and display its content?</h3>
<p>The shortest way to open a text file is by using "with" command in the following manner:</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">

    fileData = fp.read()  
# To print the contents of the file   
print(fileData)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
"The data of the file will be printed."
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">42) What is the usage of enumerate () function in Python?</h3>
<p>The enumerate() function is used to iterate through the sequence and retrieve the index position and its corresponding value at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
list_1 = ["A","B","C"]
s_1 = "Javatpoint" 
# creating enumerate objects
object_1 = enumerate(list_1)
object_2 = enumerate(s_1)
 
print ("Return type:",type(object_1))
print (list(enumerate(list_1)))
print (list(enumerate(s_1)))
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Return type: <class 'enumerate'>
[(0, 'A'), (1, 'B'), (2, 'C')]
[(0, 'J'), (1, 'a'), (2, 'v'), (3, 'a'), (4, 't'), (5, 'p'), (6, 'o'), (7, 'i'), (8, 'n'), (9, 't')]
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">43) Give the output of this example: A[3] if A=[1,4,6,7,9,66,4,94].</h3>
<p>Since indexing starts from zero, an element present at 3rd index is 7. So, the output is 7.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">44) What is type conversion in Python?</h3>
<p>Type conversion refers to the conversion of one data type iinto another.</p>
<p><strong>int()</strong> - converts any data type into integer type</p>
<p><strong>float()</strong> - converts any data type into float type</p>
<p><strong>ord()</strong> - converts characters into integer</p>
<p><strong>hex(</strong>) - converts integers to hexadecimal</p>

# TLS for network security  
s.starttls()  
# User email Authentication  
s.login("sender@email_id", "sender_email_id_password")  
# Message to be sent  
message = "Message_sender_need_to_send"  
# Sending the mail  
s.sendmail("sender@email_id ", "receiver@email_id", message)  
</textarea></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">46) What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?</h3>
<p>In Python, lists and arrays both store data in the same way. However, lists can hold any data type of elements, whereas arrays can only hold one data type of elements.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
import array as arr
User_Array = arr.array('i', [1,2,3,4])
User_list = [1, 'abc', 1.20]
print (User_Array)
print (User_list)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])
[1, 'abc', 1.2]
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">47) What is lambda function in Python?</h3>
<p>The anonymous capability in python is a capability that is characterized without a name. The ordinary capabilities are characterized utilizing a catchphrase "def", though, the mysterious capabilities are characterized utilizing the lambda capability. Lambda functions are another name for anonymous functions</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">48) Why do lambda forms in Python not have the statements?</h3>
<p>Since the statement is used to create the new function object and return it at runtime, lambda forms in Python do not include it.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">49) What are functions in Python?</h3>
<p>A function is a piece of code that only runs when called. The def keyword is utilized when defining a Python function.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
def New_func():
    print ("Hi, Welcome to JavaTpoint")
New_func() #calling the function
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Hi, Welcome to JavaTpoint
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">50) What is __init__?</h3>
<p>The __init__ is a method or constructor in Python. This method is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/ instance of a class is created. All classes have the __init__ method.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
class Employee_1:
    def __init__(self, name, age,salary):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.salary = 20000
E_1 = Employee_1("pqr", 20, 25000)
# E1 is the instance of class Employee.
#__init__ allocates memory for E1. 
print(E_1.name)
print(E_1.age)
print(E_1.salary)
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>
pqr
20
25000
</pre></div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">51) What is self in Python?</h3>
<p>Self is a class's instance or object. This is explicitly set as the first parameter in Python. Be that as it may, this isn't true in Java where it's discretionary. It assists with separating between the techniques and properties of a class with neighborhood factors.</p>
<p>The newly created object is referred to as the self-variable in the init method, whereas the object whose method was called is referred to in other methods.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">52) In Python, how can you generate random numbers?</h3>
<p>Irregular module is the standard module that is utilized to create an irregular number. The term "method" refers to:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="python">
import random
random.random
</textarea></div>
<p>The statement random.random() strategy return the drifting point number that is in the scope of [0, 1). Float numbers are generated at random by the function. The bound methods of the hidden instances are the ones that are utilized with the random class. The Random instances can be used to demonstrate multi-threading applications that generate distinct thread instances. The following are additional random generators utilized in this:</p>
<p><strong>range (a, b):</strong> it picks a number and characterize the in the middle between [a, b). It returns the components by choosing it arbitrarily from the reach that is determined. It does not create an object of range.</p>
<p><strong>uniform, a and b:</strong> It selects a floating-point number from the [a,b] range and returns the following floating-point number: normalvariate(mean, sdev) It is utilized in the normal distribution, where the mu represents the mean and the sdev represents the standard deviation.</p>
<p>Multiple independent random number generators are created by the Random class, which is used and instantiated.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">53) What is PYTHONPATH?</h3>
<p>PYTHONPATH is a enviroment variable which is utilized when a module is imported. PYTHONPATH is also looked up whenever a module is imported to see if the imported modules are in different directories. It is used by the interpreter to choose which module to load.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">54) What are modules in Python? Name a few regularly utilized worked in modules in Python?</h3>
<p>Modules in Python are files that contain Python code. This code can either be capabilities classes or factors. A Python module is a.py file with code that can be run.</p>
<p>Some of the commonly used built-in modules are:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>os</li>
<li>sys</li>
<li>math</li>
<li>random</li>
<li>data time</li>
<li>JSON</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">55) What is the difference between range & xrange?</h3>
<p>In most respects, the functionality of xrange and range is identical. You can use them both to generate a list of integers in any way you like. The main distinction is that reach returns a Python list item and x reach returns a xrange object.</p>
<p>This indicates that unlike range, xrange does not actually produce a static list at runtime. It makes the qualities as you want them with a unique strategy called yielding. Generators are a type of object that can benefit from this approach. This indicates that the function to use is xrange if you want to create a list for a really large range, such as one billion.</p>
<p>This is especially true when working with a memory-sensitive system like a mobile phone because range will use as much memory as it can to create your integer array, which could cause a Memory Error and cause your program to crash. It's a beast that needs memories.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">56) What benefits do NumPy exhibits offer over (nested) Python records?</h3>
<p>Lists in Python work well as general-purpose containers. Due to Python's list comprehensions, they are simple to construct and manipulate, and they support insertion, deletion, appending, and concatenation in a fairly efficient manner.</p>
<p>They are constrained in a few ways: Because they can contain objects of different types, Python must store type information for each element and execute type dispatching code when operating on each element because they do not support "vectorized" operations like addition and multiplication by elements.</p>
<p>Not only is NumPy more effective, it is additionally more helpful. Numerous free vector and matrix operations enable us to sometimes avoid unnecessary work. Additionally, they are effectively implemented.</p>
<p>NumPy cluster is quicker and we get a ton worked in with NumPy, FFTs, convolutions, quick looking, essential measurements, straight polynomial math, histograms, and so on.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">57) Mention what the Django templates consist of.</h3>
<p>A simple text file serves as the template. Any text-based format, including XML, CSV, and HTML, can be created by it. A layout contains factors that get supplanted with values when the format is assessed and labels (% tag %) that control the rationale of the layout.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/python-interview-q57.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">58) Explain the use of session in Django framework?</h3>
<p>Django gives a meeting that allows the client to store and recover information on a for each site-guest premise. By placing a session ID cookie on the client side and storing all relevant data on the server side, Django abstracts the sending and receiving of cookies.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/python-interview-q58.png" alt="Python Interview Questions" />
<p>So, the data itself is not stored client side. This is good from a security perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> D: Only Statement 2</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Python utilizes the Reference Considering calculation its Garbage Assortment method. This method is easy to use and very effective; It cannot, however, identify the reference cycle. As a result, the reference cycle is the sole focus of Python's Generational Cyclic (GC) algorithm.</p>

<div id="workspace6"></div>
<div class="testanswer" id="answer6">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> C: Only Statement 3</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Local scope, otherwise called capability scope, is the block of code or body of any capability in Python. The names that we specify within the function make up this scope. Only the function code will be able to see these names. We will have as many distinct local scopes as calls to the function because it is created at the function call rather than at the function's definition. This holds true regardless of whether the same function is called multiple times or recursively. Each call will return another nearby extension.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A: 10</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 10 is printed.</p>
<p>Whenever we redistribute a worldwide variable in the local extent of a capability, the movement just holds inside the nearby extension. When the code returns the global scope, the variable returns to the global value.</p>

<div id="workspace8"></div>
<div class="testanswer" id="answer8">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> C: 21</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 21 is printed.</p>
<p>In the beginning, 21 is assigned to the variable myint. Since the if False statement predicts False, the myint = 34 reassignment never takes place. The reassignment that takes place in the myfunction() function takes place not in the global scope but rather in the local scope. The value of the variable myint in the global scope remains unchanged at 21 when we attempt to access it.</p>

<p class="pq">9) Among the following statements based on the difference between lists and tuples, which one statement is TRUE?</p>
<p><strong>Statement 1:</strong> List is a sequence data structure, whereas Tuple is not.</p>
<p><strong>Statement 2:</strong> Lists are immutable; however, Tuples are mutable.</p>
<p><strong>Statement 3:</strong> Tuple is a sequence data structure, whereas List is not.</p>
<p><strong>Statement 4:</strong> Tuples are immutable; however, Lists are mutable.</p>

<div id="workspace9"></div>
<div class="testanswer" id="answer9">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> B: Statement 4</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Aside from numerous similitudes, one of the massive contrasts between the two is that the Rundowns are changeable, though Tuples are unchanging. This assertion suggests that we can change or change the upsides of a rundown; be that as it may, we can't change the upsides of a Tuple.</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer10">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A: [7, 9, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 6]</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The element is removed from the list using the pop() function. The data element to be removed from the list's index value, n, is the function's parameter.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the pop(n) capability eliminates the nth component from the rundown. The index number is 2, just like in the case above. As a result, the pop(2) function removes element 8 from my_list.</p>
